# Tape Farm for TPRR

## Description
A simple tape farm for TPRR (https://www.roblox.com/games/373513488/FNAF-TPRR-INTO-THE-PIT). The script requires a valid key to function, which changes weekly.

## Key System
To use this script, you must obtain a key that will grant you access. The key is updated weekly, so youâ€™ll need to join our Discord server to get the latest key.

### How to Get the Key:
1. Join our Discord server: [https://discord.gg/ZhGzDXz2jU](https://discord.gg/ZhGzDXz2jU)
2. Look for announcements regarding the current key in the designated channel.
3. Enter the key in the script when prompted to access the features.

## Usage
- Press **J** to toggle the farm.
- Press **X** to stop farming and close the GUI.

### Script to Run
To use the script, replace `KEY` with the correct key and run the following code in your exploit:

```lua
--Replace KEY with the correct key
getgenv().userInputKey = "KEY"
loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/3Oxygen3/TPRR-Tape-Farm/main/Farm.lua"))()
```
